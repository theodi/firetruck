        <div class="fifth_column grey_column"><b>About The Work</b><br /><br />
            William Blake's Jerusalem is considered the defining narrative of this ‘green and pleasant land’. Poet Mr Gee explores Blake’s work through the 24 official languages of the European Union as well as Welsh and Scots Gaelic, via Google Translate’s AI system.<br /><br />

            Using the visual metaphor of an airport arrivals board, incoming ‘planes’ bring the free movement of people, language, and interpretation. Old meanings deteriorate as new ideas emerge according to algorithmic assumptions and corruptions.<br /><br />

            In this interactive online version, you are invited to maneouver your way through the ‘airport’ to decide where you want the poem to take you.
        </div>
        <div class="fifth_column grey_column">

            In ‘Arrivals’, you can watch the animation cycle before moving on to the interactive sections: ‘Baggage Reclaim’ and ‘Lost Luggage’. In ‘Baggage Reclaim’, you select luggage from across the EU to access videos of native speakers reciting the mistranslations.<br /><br />

            New meanings are found and old sentiments deteriorate as the poem moves between different voices, languages and dialects.<br /><br />

            In ‘Lost Luggage’ random verses from each translation are combined together to form an aggregate poem of multiple voices and mistranslations which changes upon each playing. The original poem’s point of view shifts between the sinister, the banal, the hilarious and the absurd. <br /><br />

            Curated by Hannah Redler Hawes, Julie Freeman and Anna Scott<br /><br />
            Copy That? ODI Data as Culture research and partnership season for 2019–2020. It encompasses an exhibition at the ODI and separate but interconnected installations, performances and events at our HQ and elsewhere.

            Copy That? asks: how ‘true’ is the data ‘you’ and how many versions exist online? From the myth of the perfect digital copy to the benefits and pitfalls of simulation, we question the purpose and trustworthiness of incessantly reproduced data. What gets lost or gained in translation? How important are corruption or interference to creating and revealing ‘true’ copies? Moreover, as the internet creaks under the volumes of data being copied and shared, servers heat up, fuelling growing concerns about our climate. What number and kind of copies should a healthy internet be able to sustain?<br /><br />
